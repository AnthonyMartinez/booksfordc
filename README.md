# booksfordc

Scrapes DC Public Library's improperly syndicating RSS feeds to generate a listing of new additions to the book catalog.

Scraper running on [morph.io](https://morph.io/evonfriedland/booksfordc) and tweeting at [@booksfordc](https://twitter.com/booksfordc).

##To do##
* ~~Caching~~
* ~~Check cache~~
* ~~RSS feed~~
* Use Twitter API directly, with staggered posts (<1/min) instead of IFTTT
* Host cron job elsewhere to trigger more frequent automatic scrapes
